# Text Summarization using BART

Group project for a Deep Learning course at HEC Paris. Chosen subject: text summarization with Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformers.

This repo presents our results in a Streamlit app. We compare BART with a smaller version of BART trained on Xsum and fine-tuned without any freezed layer.
